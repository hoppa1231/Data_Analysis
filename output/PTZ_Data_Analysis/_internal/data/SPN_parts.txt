spn518 - Requested Torque/Torque Limit - Parameter provided to the engine or retarder in the torque/speed control
message for controlling or limiting the output torque. Requested torque to the engine is measured in indicated torque as a percentage of
reference engine torque (see the engine configuration message, PGN 65251). This is the engine torque at which the engine is expected
to operate if the torque control mode is active or the engine torque which the engine is not expected to exceed if the torque limit mode is
active. Zero torque can be requested which implies zero fuel and, according to Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B, the engine will not
be allowed to stall. The actual engine percent torque (SPN 513) should be zero and the engine should decelerate until the low idle
governor kicks in, at which time the actual engine percent torque will be calculated as shown in Figures SPN512_A and SPN512_B and
the engine torque mode bits (SPN 899) should be equal to 0000b - Low Idle Governor. Requested torque to the retarder is measured in
indicated torque as a percentage of reference retarder torque (see the retarder configuration message, PGN 65249). The logic used in
enabling or disabling the retarder is based on the override control mode priority bits (SPN 897). A zero torque request to the retarder is
a disable request, and is used by a J1939 node to prevent the retarder from being activated by other combinations of inputs outside of
J1939 commands. The Torque Limit Mode is commonly used for this purpose.

spn519 - Engine's Desired Operating Speed Asymmetry Adjustment - This byte is utilized in transmission gear
selection routines and indicates the engine's preference of lower versus higher engine speeds should its desired speed not be achievable.
This is a scaled ratio such that 125 represents an equal preference for a speed lower or higher that the engine's indicated desired speed.
The higher the asymmetry adjustment value is above 125, the more the engine prefers to be operated at or above its indicated desired
speed. Conversely, the lower the asymmetry adjustment value is below 125, the more the engine prefers to operate at or below its
indicated desired speed. Typically, the engine's asymmetry adjustment will be predicated on fuel consumption considerations, and
under these conditions, the method for computing the asymmetry adjustment is indicated in Figure SPN519_A. The engine may include
other factors into its asymmetry adjustment calculation such as temperatures, pressures, and other operating parameters.

Forward selector position from drive (0xF5 to 0xEF) - Indicates shift selector position in reference to the `Drive' position on the
selector. It is possible that the shift selector software may not know the number of forward ranges. The shift selector may identify
the position selected by the operator while the transmission ECU determines what range or gear that represents. If there is a digital
display, the transmission ECU would communicate what is to be displayed via another message such as ETC#2 or ETC#7.
For example: Consider a vehicle with a 5-speed automatic transmission with the shift lever on the column. Suppose that shift
selector has a limited number of positions, such that having positions for D-4-3-2-1 is not an option. For this example, assume
there are only have enough lever positions for D-3-2-1. Pulling the lever into "D" will put the transmission in 5th (highest gear). It
is desired that pulling the lever to the physical '3' position will limit the transmission to a maximum range of 3rd gear.
When the selector is pulled down into "3", the shifter selector itself has no way of correlating this physical lever position to the
desired gear; it would have to be calibrated with software to tell it this information. If not calibrated, the shift selector cannot
directly command the transmission to go to 3rd gear; it only knows it's one notch below drive.
However, if "D-1" (lever position, as opposed to desired gear) is broadcast by the selector, the transmission ECU can receive this
and then make the determination of what range is desired. The benefit is that no specific calibration of the shift selector is
required.
Between selector positions (0xEE to 0xE2) - Indicates the shift selector is not in an appropriate position. If a lever-type shift
selector with a mechanical display is stuck between detents, it may appear to the operator that it is in the desired position when in
fact it is not. The shift selector may be capable of reporting only that it is between positions or that it is between forward or
reverse positions. If known, the transmission ECU may respond differently depending on which positions are involved.
Reselect current position (0xE1) - If the TC1 message continues to send the position last selected, then a capability to reselect the
same position is required. For example: If a `Neutral to Drive' shift is selected and that shift is inhibited (say for high engine
speed), it may be necessary for the operator to reselect `Drive' after the inhibit conditions pass in order for the transmission ECU
to honor the request.
Position unknown and/or no buttons pressed (0xE0) - A push-button style shift selector with momentary contact buttons may send
this indicator after initialization before any buttons are pressed, or before the transmission ECU determines and communicates the
initial selection. This indicator could also be sent between button presses as an alternative to sending the last button press.

spn695 - Override Control Mode - The override control mode defines which sort of command is used:
00 Override disabled - Disable any existing control commanded by the source of this command.
01 Speed control - Govern speed to the included 'desired speed' value.
10 Torque control - Control torque to the included 'desired torque' value.
11 Speed/torque limit control - Limit speed and/or torque based on the included limit values. The speed limit governor is a droop
governor where the speed limit value defines the speed at the maximum torque available during this operation.
If a device wants to know whether it has access to the engine, there are several possibilities:
a. Comparing its command with the actual engine broadcasts.
b. Looking at command modes from other devices.
c. Looking to the engine and retarder torque mode.
Remarks:
a. The realization of a torque limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the speed limit to a high value (0xFAFF).
b. The realization of a speed limit (minimum selection) is possible by setting the torque limit to a high value (0xFA).
c. Limiting the retarder torque means to limit the magnitude of the torque request. As the brake torque is represented by negative
torque values, the limitation must be done by a maximum selection of the requested torque and the retarder internal torque signals.
d. For torque increasing functions, time limits for the torque or speed value (command) and the direct modes are desirable.
e. The selection of which device has control of the engine's speed or torque depends on the override mode priority (see SPN 897)
with the highest priority device gaining control. In the case of two devices with identical priority, the engine responds to
speed/torque control commands over speed/torque limit commands and will act on the speed or torque commands on a first come,
first served basis. The torque limit will be a 'lowest wins' selection (e.g., if one device commands 60% limit and another 80%
limit, then the engine will limit torque to 60%). Figure SPN695_A provides a flowchart of the torque/speed control priority
selection logic.

spn696 - Requested Speed Control Conditions - This mode tells the engine control system the governor characteristics
that are desired during speed control. The four characteristics defined are:
00 Transient Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions
01 Stability Optimized for driveline disengaged and non-lockup conditions
10 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 1 (e.g., vehicle driveline)
11 Stability Optimized for driveline engaged and/or in lockup condition 2 (e.g., PTO driveline)
00b - This speed governor gain selection is adjusted to provide rapid transition between speed setpoints. RPM overshoot and
undershoot may be greater than what is seen when the 'speed control characteristic' is set to be stability optimized.
01b - This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given an expected plant consisting of
the engine and its accessory loads. This gain adjustment is not intended to compensate for driveline characteristics. This
characteristic is most appropriate when no driveline is connected.
10b - This control condition has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given a more complex plant. For
instance, the more complex plant would contain the engine, its accessory loads and the driveline characteristics. As an example,
the driveline characteristics might include the effective spring mass relationship of pumps, tires, clutches, axles, driveshafts, and
multiple gear ratios. This characteristic is most appropriate when a driveline is engaged.
11b - This speed control characteristic is available for applications requiring compensation for more than one driveline
characteristic. It has been optimized to minimize rpm overshoot and undershoot given a more complex plant of the second variety.
This more complex plant would again contain the engine, its accessory loads and a second driveline characteristic unique from the
one described in speed control characteristic 10b.

spn897 - Override Control Mode Priority - This field is used as an input to the engine or retarder to determine the
priority of the Override Control Mode received in the Torque/Speed Control message (see PGN 0). The default is 11 (Low priority). It
is not required to use the same priority during the entire override function. For example, the transmission can use priority 01 (High
priority) during a shift, but can set the priority to 11 (Low priority) at the end of the shift to allow traction control to also interact with
the torque limit of the engine.
The four priority levels defined are:
00 Highest priority
01 High priority
10 Medium priority
11 Low priority
00b - Highest Priority = Used for situations that require immediate action by the receiving device in order to provide safe vehicle
operation (i.e., braking systems). This level of priority should only be used in safety critical conditions.
01b - High Priority = Used for control situations that require prompt action in order to provide safe vehicle operation. An example
is when the transmission is performing a shift and requires control of the engine in order to control driveline reengagement.
10b - Medium Priority = Used for powertrain control operations which are related to assuring that the vehicle is in a stable
operating condition. An example is when the traction control system is commanding the engine in order to achieve traction
stability.
11b - Low Priority = Used to indicate that the associated command desires powertrain control but is needed for function which
improves the driver comfort which may be overridden by other devices. An example is cruise control or the non-critical part of a
transmission shift to a new gear.

spn901 - Retarder Type - A vehicle retarder is a supplementary device to the wheel brakes for the driver to better control the
vehicle. The wheel brakes used in the vehicle are not designed for continuous retarding operation. In a prolonged period of braking, the
brakes can be thermally over-stressed, causing the braking effect to be reduced or even lead to complete braking system failure. The
vehicle retarder is designed for continuous operation for braking during downhill operation and is also used for braking the vehicle to
comply with speed limits and traffic conditions.

spn1845 - Transmission Torque Limit - Parameter provided to the engine from the transmission as a torque limit to be
invoked by the engine in the event that J1939 communication with the transmission is lost. The intention is to protect transmissions that
use a continuous torque limit during torque converter mode or operation in specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may
reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity. If communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque
output could harm the transmission. It is recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission 'heartbeat'.
In the event that the ETC#1 message is not received in a time period of 5 times its' broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine
should invoke a torque limit holding the engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter. The
engine may release the limit when transmission-to-engine communication is re-established. A value of 0xFF00 to 0xFFFF indicates that
no transmission torque limit is desired. It is expected that the engine will record this torque value in non-volatile memory and will
include this in the engine configuration PGN as parameter Default Engine Torque Limit (SPN 1846) If the engine observes change in
this parameter value on power-up, the engine should record the new value.

spn1846 - Default Engine Torque Limit - Companion parameter to Transmission Torque Limit (SPN 1845). This 'echo'
parameter provides confirmation to the transmission that the engine has received and will invoke the requested Transmission Torque
Limit in the event that J1939 communication is lost between the two devices. If the engine supports this protection logic, the Default
Engine Torque Limit parameter should be set equal to the Transmission Torque Limit parameter as received in the Transmission
Configuration message (PGN 65250). Otherwise, a Default Engine Torque Limit value of FF00 to FFFF indicates that no default engine
torque limit has been received or set. The intention is to protect transmissions that use a continuous torque limit during torque converter
mode or operation in specific lower gears, where stall or drivetrain torque may reach levels higher than the gearbox capacity. If
communication is lost during torque limited operation, unrestricted engine torque output could harm the transmission. It is
recommended that engines use reception of the ETC#1 message as a transmission 'heartbeat'. In the event that the ETC#1 message is
not received in a time period of 5 times its' broadcast rate (5 x 10 ms = 50 ms), the engine should invoke a torque limit holding the
engine to less than or equal to the value of the Transmission Torque Limit parameter. The engine may release the limit when
engine-to-transmission communication is re-established.

spn1849 - Transmission Requested Range Display Flash State - State signal indicating a transmission request

Display Flash State' indicator can be utilized by (but not limited to) the shift console, instrument cluster, or cab display. Definition of
the cause of this state is at the discretion of the transmission manufacturer. The flash period shall be 700 ms @ 50% duty cycle.
Transmission manufacturers may want to flash the Transmission Requested Range display depending on certain events. It could
be because a gear could not be attained, or because fluid is low, etc. Indicator should be on for 350 ms and off for 350 ms.

Definition of the cause of this state is at the discretion of the transmission manufacturer
Transmission manufacturers may want to blank the Transmission Requested Range display depending on certain events. Typically
it is an indication of a shift selector problem.
